  eventName: Blade Of The Blood God
  eventDescription: "Emerging through a thick forest fog, the party happens upon what
    appears to be an ancient ruin with a shrine at its centre. Despite the ruin's
    delapidated and crumbling state, the shrine is somehow perfectly preserved and
    undamaged, with a sword resting atop it. Inching closer, the party gets an instant
    feeling of dread, and begins to make out the inscription on the shrine...\n\r\n\u201CWhomsoever
    takes up this sword shall wield the power of the blood god. Just as you draw blood,
    so shall the blade draw from you\u201D."
