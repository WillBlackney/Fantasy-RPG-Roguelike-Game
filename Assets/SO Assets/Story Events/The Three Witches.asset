  eventName: The Three Witches
  eventDescription: "As the party reaches the peak of a mountain, they spot the flickering
    light of a camp fire coming from a nearby cave, permeating an awful smell. Upon
    entering the cave,  the party spots of a group of three witches huddled over a
    cauldron, tossing in a whole manner of obscure ingredients. The witches immediately
    notice the partys presence, and begin chanting in unison.\n\nAsk us for wisdom,
    and you shall see! Smarter, brighter and brainy you'll be!\n\r\nAsk us for riches,
    \ treasures and gold! All will tremble in the power you hold!\n\r\nAsk us for
    health, strength and life! Shield you from death, struggles and strife!"
