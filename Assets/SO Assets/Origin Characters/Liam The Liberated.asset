  characterDescription: 'In your human life, you served your kingdom as a battle
    mage. But when you fell in battle, the Nari Cultists brought you back and enslaved
    you to their dark will. For centuries, you forcibly served your necromantic masters
    as a foot soldier in their undead legion. But something happened during the cataclysm.
    The dark magic that bound you to their will was broken, and at last freedom was
    yours. Considered an abomination by your human peers, you left your homeland
    for a new life in the city of Herp Derp. But you still hear the old masters voice
    in the back of your head. It is time to finish what they started: kill the masters
    and take back your free will!'
