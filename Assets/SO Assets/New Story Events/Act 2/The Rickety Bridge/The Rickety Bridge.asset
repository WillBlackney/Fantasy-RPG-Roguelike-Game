  storyInitialDescription: '

    Travelling across the vast badlands desert, your
    party comes across a wide and deep chasm, most likely caused by an earthquake
    during the cataclysm. A rickety, orc made bridge extends across the chasm, providing
    a means of crossing. As you move closer to begin crossing, you begin to notice
    just how unsafe and poorly maintained the bridge is. Multiple foot planks are
    missing, and the supporting structures seem to be held together by low quality,
    poorly knotted rope.'
