  storyInitialDescription: "An old orc sits by the edge of the Kings Road in a slouch,
    looking visibly disheartened. Scores of fallen kingsguard, orcs, undead and Nari
    cultists litter the area surrounding him. As you approach, he lifts his sullen
    gaze to meet your own, before staring back down at his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CThree
    months...three stinking months i\u2019ve been sitting by this road, waiting for
    a worthy warrior to give me a proper death and send me to my god. All the friends
    of my youth have fallen in the shield wall and now drink with the gods, and yet
    not once has a blade touched me\u2026why do the gods hate me so....\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter
    taking a brief pause from his sullen, self loathing soliloquy, a wave of excitement
    washes over his face as he jumps to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what if you could
    be the ones! YES! It MUST be you! Please strangers, have mercy on an old orc.
    Fight me to the death! Put me in the ground so that I might earn my place in
    valhalla! What say you?\u201D"
